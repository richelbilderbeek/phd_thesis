  elocation-id	= {085431},
  year		= {2017},
  doi		= {10.1101/085431},
  publisher	= {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
  abstract	= {Geographic isolation that drives speciation is often
		  assumed to slowly increase over time, for instance through
		  the formation of rivers, the formation of mountains or the
		  movement of tectonic plates. Cyclic changes in connectivity
		  between areas may occur with the advancement and retraction
		  of glaciers, with water level fluctuations in seas between
		  islands or in lakes that have an uneven bathymetry. These
		  habitat dynamics may act as a driver of allopatric
		  speciation and propel local diversity. Here we present a
		  parsimonious model of the interaction between cyclical (but
		  not necessarily periodic) changes in the environment and
		  speciation, and provide an ABC-SMC method to infer the
		  rates of allopatric and sympatric speciation from a
		  phylogenetic tree. We apply our approach to the posterior
		  sample of an updated phylogeny of the Lamprologini, a tribe
		  of cichlid fish from Lake Tanganyika where such cyclic
		  changes in water level have occurred. We find that water
		  level changes play a crucial role in driving diversity in
		  Lake Tanganyika. We note that if we apply our analysis to
		  the Most Credible Consensus (MCC) tree, we do not find
		  evidence for water level changes influencing diversity in
		  the Lamprologini, suggesting that the MCC tree is a
		  misleading representation of the true species tree.
		  Furthermore, we note that the signature of habitat dynamics
		  is found in the posterior sample despite the fact that this
		  sample was constructed using a species tree prior that
		  ignores habitat dynamics. However, in other cases this
		  species tree prior might erase this signature. Hence we
		  argue that in order to improve inference of the effect of
		  habitat dynamics on biodiversity, phylogenetic
		  reconstruction methods should include tree priors that
		  explicitly take into account such dynamics.},
